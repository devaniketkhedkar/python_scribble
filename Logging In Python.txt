Writing logs to a logfile in Python is a straightforward process that involves using the `logging` module, which is part of Python's standard library. 
Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set up logging in your Python code:

1. **Import the Logging Module**: Start by importing the `logging` module at the beginning of your script.
   ```python
   import logging
   ```

2. **Configure the Logging**: Use `logging.basicConfig()` to configure the logging. You can specify the filename, log level, and the format of the log messages.
   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', filemode='w', format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
   ```

3. **Write Log Messages**: Use the logging functions like `logging.debug()`, `logging.info()`, `logging.warning()`, `logging.error()`, and `logging.critical()` 
to write messages to the log file.
   ```python
   logging.info('This is an info message')
   logging.warning('This is a warning message')
   ```

Here's a complete example that includes all the steps:

```python
import logging

# Configure the logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', filemode='w', format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

# Example log messages
logging.info('This is an info message')
logging.warning('This is a warning message')
logging.error('This is an error message')
```

In this example:
- `filename='app.log'` specifies the name of the logfile.
- `filemode='w'` means the log file will be overwritten each time the program runs. Use `'a'` for appending if you want to keep the log history.
- The `format` parameter defines the structure of the log messages.
- `level=logging.INFO` sets the threshold for logging messages. Only messages with this level or higher will be tracked.

Remember to replace `'app.log'` with the desired path and filename for your log file.

If you need more advanced logging features, such as different log levels for different handlers or logging to multiple destinations, you can create logger 
objects and configure them accordingly.
